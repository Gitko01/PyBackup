# PyBackup
### A backup app made using Python  

PyBackup is a free app I made for automatic backups of files.  
I originally made this app because I didn't want to pay for a backup app,  
and I felt it would be an interesting first public app to make.

## Download
You can either download it from my [website](https://gitko01.github.io/website), the [releases](https://github.com/Gitko01/PyBackup/releases) section of this repo,  
or you can just download the [source code](https://github.com/Gitko01/PyBackup/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and install the dependencies yourself.  
I suggest the releases section of this repo or the website.

## Warning
This is the first app that I've made, so I am sure there is some bug that  
I haven't found that could cause a problem. Use my app at your own risk!

## Bugs
Please report all bugs to the [issues](https://github.com/Gitko01/PyBackup/issues) section of this repo!

## Some thanks
Thanks to the developers of Python!  
Thanks to the developers of shutil, tkinter, calendar, time, and datetime!  
Without these Python libraries my app most likely wouldn't exist!
